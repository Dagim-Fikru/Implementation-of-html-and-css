        <h2>1.Covid 19</h2>
        <img src="../images/covid.jpg" alt="photo for covid" />
        <p>
          The pandemic has altered peopleâ€™s lives in both enormous and small
          ways. Our editors have picked the top recent blogs that dig into the
          details of what COVID-19 means for people: the impact on women and the
          young, what it means for the food supply, and how it can increase
          already growing inequality, to name a few. COVID-19 is a stark
          reminder of longstanding inequities in our societies, and how policies
          need to pay specific attention to protect and lift the least
          advantaged in society.

        <h2>2.Peace</h2>
        <img src="../images/peace.jpg" alt="photo for Peace" />
        <p>
          Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence
          of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used
          to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of
          violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history, leaders
          have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral
          restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or
          economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties.

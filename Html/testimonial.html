You have met those needs and then some! We have had nothing but rave comments about the site from those who are closest to it and rely on it the most. I personally want to thank you and your staff for their patience and diligence in promptly meeting each of our requests for the site during its development."</td>

They handle things very efficiently and are available for any questions we have. They also keep us updated on monthly reports so we know how our site is doing.
